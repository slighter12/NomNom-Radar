Your personal foodie radar! Automatically detects nearby food trucks and sends out a "Nom Nom" alert.

NomNom-Radar is a real-time notification backend service. It utilizes PostgreSQL with PostGIS for high-performance geospatial queries to track mobile food vendors and notify users when deliciousness is near.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **Real-time Vendor Tracking**: Allows food truck owners to update their location instantly via a simple API endpoint.
* **Dynamic Geofencing**: Users can define a custom notification radius (e.g., 500 meters, 1 km).
* **High-Performance Geospatial Queries**: Leverages the power of PostGIS (`ST_DWithin`) for efficient, low-latency proximity checks.
* **Push Notification System**: Integrates with services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to deliver instant alerts to users' devices.
* **Open & Share-Alike**: Licensed under AGPL-3.0 to encourage community contribution while protecting the project from being used in proprietary, closed-source commercial services.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend**: **Go** with a standard library or a framework like **Gin / Echo**
* **Database**: PostgreSQL + PostGIS extension for geospatial data
* **Database Driver/ORM**: **GORM / sqlx**
* **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)
* **Containerization**: Docker & Docker Compose

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (e.g., v1.21 or later)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project for push notifications.

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NomNom-Radar.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/NomNom-Radar.git)
    cd NomNom-Radar
    ```

## ü§î How It Works

1.  **Vendor Pings Location**: A food truck owner sends a `POST` request with their `vendorId` and current coordinates (`latitude`, `longitude`) to the `/api/vendors/location` endpoint.
2.  **Location is Stored**: The Go service updates the vendor's location in the PostGIS database. The location is stored as a `GEOGRAPHY` or `GEOMETRY` type using a Go database driver.
3.  **Proximity Check Job**: A background Goroutine or scheduled job runs periodically (e.g., every minute).
4.  **Geospatial Query**: The worker queries the database, asking: "For each user, are there any vendors within their specified notification radius?" This is efficiently handled by the PostGIS `ST_DWithin` function.
5.  **Notification Sent**: If a match is found, the service triggers a push notification via FCM to the relevant user's device, letting them know a favorite food truck is nearby.
